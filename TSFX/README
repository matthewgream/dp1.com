This is my TSF with DD's faster Bcrypt, also itll compile under DJGCC with
the following makefile and stuff..

Note: You will need 'go32' (32bit mode launcher), distributed with the
      DJGCC release, and its associated peripherals (ie VGA driver and
      387 emulator), with correctly setup environment variables, ie:

                GCCBIN  = g:\dj\bin
                GCCLIB  = g:\dj\lib
                GCCINC  = g:\dj\include
                GO32    = ansi driver g:\dj\drivers\vga.grd gw 1024 gh 768
                          emu g:\dj\emu387\emu387
                GO32TMP = g:\tmp

IE: If you dont have a 386 AND you dont have go32 then the executables
    distributed here WILL NOT WORK, you can go and compile with turboC
    or something but then you will probably get stuck with the 64k
    seg limits

Bugz: none (i hope :-\), well none that i can see, youll get a warning on
      compilation about the signal(..) in line 870 (thereabouts) and djgcc
      doesnt like this at all. hence ctrl-c is not trapped, I couldnt fix
      this straight away (something screwy with djgcc), I tried defining
      the signal handler as void, nup, just doesnt like it, who cares
      anyway..

Ohh well, if you have any questions just ask. as in the original TSF
release, this program and its side products were created to make my
activities easier , if you dont like em, or prefer something else, then
nick off. Constructive criticism and ideas welcomed, send the rest to
255.255.255.255. You can find me on IRC , my BBS or other places if
you look hard enuf..

And TSF was original conceived in December91/January92, after KC9 was
released but before I had my hands on it. (despite this , there are a lot
of design similarities)
